            <li>D=2r</li>
            <li>Among all clossed curves with the same gap, there is the largest area.</li>
            <li>Through three points that do not lie on the same straight line, you can only daraw one line.</li>
            <li>The shortest distance from the centor of the stake to the chord is less than the radius.</li>
            <li>If twj stakes tiuch at one point, then that point on straight line that passes through the centers of these stakes. </li>

            <p class="div2">The main properties of tangents to a circle</p>
           
        </div>
    <ol class="all2">
        <li> The tangent is always perpendicular to the radius of the circle drawn to the point of contact.</li>
        <li> The shortest distance from the center of the circle to the tangent is equal to the radius of the circle.</li>
        <li> If two tangents, with points of contact B and C, on the same circle are not parallel, then they intersect at point A, and the segment between the point of contact and the point of intersection of one tangent is equal to the same segment on the other tangent:
            AB = AC.</li>
            <ol></ol>Also, if you draw a straight line through the center of the circle O and the intersection point A of these tangents, then the angle formed between one tangent and this straight line will be equal to the angle between the other tangent and this straight line:
            ∠ОАС = ∠OAB
        </ol>
