               A circle is a set of all points on the plane that are at the same distance from a given point O , which is called the center of the circle .

                 A unit circle is a circle whose radius is equal to one.

            A circle is a part of a plane bounded by a circle.

                The radius of the circle R is the distance from the center of the circle O to any point of the circle.

                The diameter of the circle D is the segment that connects two points of the circle and passes through its center.

                    Tangent is a coplanar straight line that touches the circle at a single point.

        </div>
    <ol class="all2">
        <li> The tangent is always perpendicular to the radius of the circle drawn to the point of contact.</li>
        <li> The shortest distance from the center of the circle to the tangent is equal to the radius of the circle.</li>
        <li> If two tangents, with points of contact B and C, on the same circle are not parallel, then they intersect at point A, and the segment between the point of contact and the point of intersection of one tangent is equal to the same segment on the other tangent:
            AB = AC.</li>
            <li>Also, if you draw a straight line through the center of the circle O and the intersection point A of these tangents, then the angle formed between one tangent and this straight line will be equal to the angle between the other tangent and this straight line:</li>
            ∠ОАС = ∠OAB
